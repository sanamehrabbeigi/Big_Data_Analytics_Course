# Big_Data_Course

Assignmnet2:
A binary classification model to predict income levels based on the UCI Adult dataset using Apache Spark MLlib on Azure Databricks. Processed large-scale data with Spark DataFrame, implemented a full ML pipeline, and applied multiple supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Gradient Boosting Trees, Linear SVM, and One-vs-Rest classifiers. Conducted hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Optimized Spark operations for scalable data processing and provided insights on model performance to guide data-driven decision-making.


Final Project:
Initial Goal:  credit scoring model to predict and calculate customer credit score + credit level

Data cleaning and reducing dimensions: *Input:* a dataset with 460000 rows and 56 columns --> *Output:* a dataset with 371075 rows and 15 columns
